In this project, if we have a query that is eligible for join rewriting, our program will:
    1. Rewrite the join, print it to standard out.
    2. Evaluate the rewritten join query and print the output xml to the standard out as well.
If the query is not eligible for rewriting, we will simply print out the xml output.

Here is a sample output:
Rewritten Query: 
for $tuple in join (for $s in doc("j_caesar.xml")//SPEAKER, $stxt in $s/text() where $stxt eq "CAESAR" return <tuple>{<stxt>{$stxt}</stxt>, <s>{$s}</s>}</tuple>, for $a in doc("j_caesar.xml")//ACT, $sp in $a//SPEAKER return <tuple>{<sp>{$sp}</sp>, <a>{$a}</a>}</tuple>, [s], [sp]) return <act>{$tuple/a/*/TITLE/text()}</act>
